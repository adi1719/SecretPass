  <h1>Secret, I never told</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Every full moon, a chilling silence descends upon the small town of Ravenwood. It's said that on these nights, a
      shadowy figure roams the streets, leaving behind a trail of blood and despair. Locals whisper of the unsolved
      murder that took place years ago in the old abandoned mansion at the edge of town. They say the victim's restless
      spirit seeks vengeance, and those who dare to venture near the mansion vanish without a trace.</li>
    <li>Deep in the heart of the forest lies a forgotten graveyard, where the souls of the unjustly slain are said to
      roam. Legend has it that on the anniversary of their deaths, the spirits awaken seeking revenge on the living. The
      only warningâ€”a chilling melody that echoes through the trees, haunting anyone who dares to venture too close.</li>
    <li>In the dimly lit streets of the city, a serial killer lurks in the shadows, preying on unsuspecting victims.
      Each murder more gruesome than the last, leaving behind a trail of terror and unanswered questions. As the body
      count rises, fear grips the city, and whispers of the elusive killer spread like wildfire.</li>
    <li>High upon the hill, overlooking the sleepy town, stands the imposing figure of Blackwood Manor. Once a place of
      grandeur and opulence, it now lies abandoned, a dark reminder of the tragedy that befell its inhabitants. They say
      on stormy nights, the ghostly cries of the murdered echo through the halls, a chilling reminder of the horrors
      that took place within its walls.</li>
    <li>In the depths of the swamp, a sinister secret lies buried beneath the murky waters. Legend has it that on
      moonless nights, the vengeful spirit of a wronged woman rises from the depths, seeking retribution on those who
      wronged her. They say those who hear her mournful cries are doomed to meet a grisly fate.</li>
    <li>Deep within the confines of the abandoned asylum, a madman stalks the halls, his deranged laughter echoing
      through the empty corridors. They say he was once a patient, driven to madness by the horrors he witnessed within
      those walls. Now, he seeks to share his torment with anyone foolish enough to set foot inside.</li>
  </ul>
